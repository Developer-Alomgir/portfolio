Alomgir Hossen — Next.js portfolio (hotlink image version)
--------------------------------------------------------

This project hotlinks images to your ArtStation project pages (public project URLs).
You chose option B — images are loaded from remote URLs (ArtStation or placeholders).
After you download the zip, to deploy on Vercel:

  1. unzip
  2. npm install
  3. npm run dev  (or push to GitHub and import on Vercel)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Hotlinking loads images from external servers (ArtStation). If any image fails to load,
  replace the `image` field in `data/projects.js` with a working image URL or download
  the artwork and put it in /public/images/ then update paths.
- Project links point to your ArtStation project pages so users can view the full artwork.
